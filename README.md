# Wedding Musician Website - Django Project

An exercise in creating a Django based website & CRM for a wedding musician. Includes Account section for customers where they can access all confirmed details of their booking, and pay online for services provided.

When my client's customers contact her, communication arrives through many and varied channels, website contact, email, FaceBook, phone, SMS etc.

This project is an attempt to provide a place where both my client and her customers can go to provide and view confirmed details respectively.

##
To display the full functionality of this website, I have created a number of dummy user accounts with associated event details which are viewable to the user. A walkthrough is provided here:
### For New Users:
A new visitor to the website will contact my client through one of the afore-mentioned channels. Once details are confirmed for an event, the web-master aska the user to register on the website if he/she should so desire to avail of this functionality, and the webmaster then creates an event in the admin panel that can then be viewed by the user and confirmed by paying a deposit through the provided Stripe link.
