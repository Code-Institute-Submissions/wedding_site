# Movie Deaths Dashboard

An exercise in Data Visualisation, using a dataset which focuses on the number of deaths that take place in movies.

It is possible to filter results by Year, Director, Genre, MPAA Rating, and Deaths per Minute.

## Qualification
Due to the limited nature of the dataset (422 movies from 1949 to 2010) it is not possible to infer too much hard fact from analysis.
This is meant purely as a learning exercise, displaying some of the features of dc.js and crossfilter.js, and aiming to increase my own knowledge of working with the Flask framework and json data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You must have Python 2.7 installed on your system, available [here](https://www.python.org/).
Download the correct version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

### requirements.txt
Create a local environment and pip install all packages listed in requirements.txt

### Local Server
Navigate to http://localhost:5000/ to view your app locally

## Built With

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - a lightweight Python web framework based on Werkzeug and Jinja 2
- [dc.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/) - JavaScript Library for Multi-Dimensional Charting
- [intro.js](http://introjs.com) - step-by-step guide and feature introduction
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - cross-platform document-oriented NoSQL database program

## Inspiration

There are a number of websites dedicated to the meticulous counting and visualisation of on-screen deaths.
- [moviebodycounts.com](http://www.moviebodycounts.com/)
- [randalolson.com](http://www.randalolson.com/2013/12/31/deadliest-films-of-all-time-by-on-screen-death-counts/) - put this dataset together

The greatest amount of credit for the inspiration for this dashboard goes to [ramiro.org](http://ramiro.org/notebook/movie-body-counts/) who created a broadly similar visualisation using different technologies with which I am not familiar (pandas, NumPy and matplotlib).

## Responsiveness
As of this point, this dashboard is not responsive due to limitations in dc.js.
The website is optimised to be viewed on a 2016 15" MacBook Pro, and will not render correctly on any other screensize.

## Testing
Manual testing was undertaken for every feature of the website and satisfactorily passed.

## Hosting
A live version of this dashboard is hosted [here](https://com-movie-dashboard.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku.
